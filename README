Note about this branch
======================

Reading diffs is so boring, therefore I'm using this branch to manually
reimplement the patch from branch peter/5.12.14-v0 from afe5d2361cfa
(v5.12.14) to 56b6b3611b3a, to get a better feel for how KVM and IoRegionFd
works under the hood.


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
